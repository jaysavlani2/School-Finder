					<p><strong>The Heart of Education is Educating the Heart

					Atmiya School, located in Rajkot. Founded in 1999, by His Holiness Hariprasad Swamiji, the school is spread in a lush green 23.5 acres campus, with hundreds of Neem trees. This makes the school environment serene and peaceful, which the student community at ASVM relishes.

					While an excellent education is essential, in the long term, quality of life is driven by one’s inner self for which a strong foundation of culture and morality is also very important. The school puts much emphasis on the moral and spiritual development of the students as it does for academic excellence. The motto of the school is Union of Body, Mind and Soul. The teachers and staff of the school strive to help students achieve this ideal state.

					To emphasize the importance of our rich heritage and diversity, the school’s annual calendar is full of cultural events, celebration of festivals and the creative assemblies through which specific values and qualities are demonstrated using the medium of dance, drama and music, performed by students with guidance from their teachers.</strong></p>

					<p><strong>The School in itself takes pride not only in fostering the academic excellence but also undertaking the physical, mental and spiritual care of your child so as to broaden one outlook and make the child useful to the society and nation at large as well as a beloved child of the Almighty. We firmly believe that education should be for life, not just for a living. The core value of this school is not on cultivating the child for the purpose of a livelihood but for the life itself. At this school the child will learn about cultures, customs and religions of other people in order to appreciate the universal oneness through a Stimulating value based learning experience. I hope to have an opportunity to welcome you and your child at a place where a child will learn grow with divinity.</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Atmiya School is a Modern Gurukul where every child is given an opportunity to enjoy his childhood as learning is made a joyful experience. It is a primary school based on universal values that are the core values of all faiths and cultures. Rather than limiting to any particular religious group. We believe that no child is fully educated unless he learns to read himself hence here at ur school we do not teach the child but just help him learn. The child here is helped to lead a value oriented life so as to understand the Indian culture & heritage. The school campus is spread over 23 Acres of pollution free environment with lush green surroundings and beautiful Landscapes that create a perfect learning environment. The school is dedicated to the divinity in every child and hence I welcome you all as your search for a good school ends here.</strong></p>
